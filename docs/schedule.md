# Things to do after each class

#### Wednedsday, January 18 (Introduction)

* Read the [syllabus](syllabus).
* Follow the ["Setup" instructions](setup) so you can run course code on your own computer.


#### Friday, January 20 (Start talking about PID controllers)

* Fill out [this form to express group preferences for your first design project](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/673116346).
* Read [the reference page on PID](reference#pid).
* (Optional) Read [Chapter 1.6 of the reference text (Feedback Systems)](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/fbs-intro_24Jul2020.pdf), or the whole of Chapter 1, for more information on PID controllers and on the idea of "control systems" in general.
* Complete [HW1 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327509).


#### Monday, January 23 (Finish talking about PID controllers + Simulation)

* Complete the ["Setup" instructions](setup) if you have not already done so, and ask for help (e.g., [campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G9558828D/), [office hours](index#instructor), etc.) if you get stuck.
* Complete [HW2 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327697).


#### Monday, January 25 (Simulation + Moving from PID to linear state feedback)

* Contact [your partner for the first design project](https://campuswire.com/c/G9558828D/feed/33), arrange a time to meet, and make sure both of you have completed the ["Setup" instructions](setup) if you have not already done so.
* Complete [HW3 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327910).
