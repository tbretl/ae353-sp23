# Things to do after each class

#### Wednedsday, January 18 (Introduction)

* Read the [syllabus](syllabus).
* Follow the ["Setup" instructions](setup) so you can run course code on your own computer.


#### Friday, January 20 (Start talking about PID controllers)

* Fill out [this form to express group preferences for your first design project](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/673116346).
* Read [the reference page on PID](reference#pid).
* (Optional) Read [Chapter 1.6 of the reference text (Feedback Systems)](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/fbs-intro_24Jul2020.pdf), or the whole of Chapter 1, for more information on PID controllers and on the idea of "control systems" in general.
* Complete [HW1 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327509).


#### Monday, January 23 (Finish talking about PID controllers + Simulation)

* Complete the ["Setup" instructions](setup) if you have not already done so, and ask for help (e.g., [campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G9558828D/), [office hours](index#instructor), etc.) if you get stuck.
* Complete [HW2 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327697).


#### Wednesday, January 25 (Simulation + Moving from PID to linear state feedback)

* Contact [your partner for the first design project](https://campuswire.com/c/G9558828D/feed/33), arrange a time to meet, and make sure both of you have completed the ["Setup" instructions](setup) if you have not already done so.
* Complete [HW3 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327910).


#### Friday, January 27 (Implementation of linear state feedback)

* Read the [guidelines for the first design project](https://tbretl.github.io/ae353-sp23/projects#design-project-1-cmg).
* Complete [HW4 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327057).


#### Monday, January 30 (Linearization to get a state space model)

* Read the [notes on linearization from class](notes/20230130-linearization.pdf).
* Read the [reference page on state space models](reference#state-space-models), which goes step-by-step through the process of linearization.
* (Optional) Read [Chapter 6.4 of the reference text (Feedback Systems)](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/fbs-linsys_24Jul2020.pdf) for more information on linearization, including alternatives to "linearization about an equilibrium point."
* Complete [HW5 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327058).

#### Wednesday, February 1 (Matrix exponential and asymptotic stability)

* Read the [notes on solving closed-loop systems with the matrix exponential function from class](notes/20230201-matrix-exponential.pdf).
* Read the reference page on [the matrix exponential function](reference#the-matrix-exponential-function) and on [asymptotic stability](reference#asymptotic-stability).
* Complete [HW6 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327059).

#### Friday, February 3 (Availability and use of example reports, summary of design process so far)

* Read the [campuswire post about prior work to learn and build upon](https://campuswire.com/c/G9558828D/feed/70) for your projects.
* Submit [DP1 Draft 1](https://tbretl.github.io/ae353-sp23/projects#draft-report-with-theory-by-1159pm-on-friday-february-3) by midnight today.
* Read the [notes on the complete design process so far, from class](notes/20230203-design-process.pdf).
* Complete [HW7 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327060).

#### Monday, February 6 (Diagonalization, Part 1)

* Re-read the reference page on [the matrix exponential function](reference#the-matrix-exponential-function) and on [asymptotic stability](reference#asymptotic-stability).
* Read the [notes on diagonalization (part 1) from class](notes/20230206-diagonalization-part-1.pdf).
* Complete [HW8 in PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/130996/assessment/2327061).
